# SilverblueSetup
A simple bash script for my Silverblue Setup

This script will:

   - Update your system to the latest version of Silverblue
   - Add Flathub, Flathub Beta and GNOME Nightly remotes for flatpak
   - Replace all the flatpaks from the fedora remote with the flatpaks from flathub
   - Install some other apps like media players, mail client, extension manager, etc etc
   - Remove the rpm Firefox and install the flatpak Firefox

This script it should be used only with Silverblue but you can use it with Kinoite as well.
